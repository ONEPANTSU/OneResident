## Introduction
OneResident is a mobile application developed on Android Studio for managing residential buildings' payment records. This application allows users to add new residents and record their payments, set reminders for upcoming payments, and manage payment delays.

## User Interface
The user interface of OneResident is designed to be simple and easy to use. The main page displays a list of apartments that are awaiting payment confirmation. For each apartment, the user can see the house name, apartment number, resident name, and the last payment date. The user can add a new resident by filling out the form with the house name, apartment number, resident name, payment date, and comment. Once a resident has been added, the user can confirm the payment by clicking the "paid" button. There is also an option to delay the payment by entering the number of days the payment will be delayed.

## Reminders
OneResident allows users to set reminders for upcoming payments with customizable intervals. The user can select an interval (for example, 3 hours, 5 hours, or a day) after which they will receive a notification reminding them of the upcoming payment. The notifications will continue until the payment is confirmed.

## Delayed Payments
If a payment is delayed, the user can enter the number of days the payment will be delayed. OneResident will then notify the user when the payment is due, starting from the day of the delay.

## Conclusion
OneResident is a useful tool for managing residential building payment records. Its simple user interface and customizable reminder system make it easy for users to keep track of upcoming payments and manage payment delays.
